OSGi is by far the best way to develop software systems and take advantage of modularity. However, until now the threshold to get started was high due to lack of a good tool chain, proper service based libraries, and tutorials, with the consequence that many people gave up before the benefits became visible.
The vision of the OSGi Alliance with the enRoute project is therefore to make OSGi as easy as possible for developers to get started with OSGi without compromising its core values.
