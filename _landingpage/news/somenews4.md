Integrate Apache Karaf and Bnd toolchain
Bnd remote launcher allows debugging bundles and Bndrun files in Eclipse using a remote Apache Karaf instance as the target OSGi runtime. This is a very convenient way to combine Apache Karaf features with the power of Bndtools OSGi toolchain.
In this app note weâ€™re going to build a simple declarative service and we are going to use Apache Karaf as a remote OSGi target runtime to debug the ds from within Eclipse.
A complete working example is available at https://github.com/mrulli/com.flairbit.examples.karaf-debug.
