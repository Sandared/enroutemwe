n the last releases of OSGi specifications Data Transfer Objects (DTOs) have become quite important. This comes as a surprise to people because DTO’s are very non-object oriented and wasn’t object oriented a euphemism for good? DTOs give up some of the benefits of object-oriented programming to avoid the horrid problems associated object serialization in strongly typed languages.
This Application note discusses the background of DTOs and attempts to explain why they are so important in modern systems.
