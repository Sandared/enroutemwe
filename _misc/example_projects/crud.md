## Description
This example is currently work in progress. It shows the progress on a project to make a full blown CRUD example with OSGi enRoute. Though OSGi enRoute contains a lot of excellent parts to do this, it shamefully lacks a database abstraction. (The reason is the highly sensitive nature of databases in Java.) [Chuck Boecking](http://erp-academy.chuckboecking.com/), whois an expert in ERP is using an open source [Mongo db bundle](https://github.com/pkriens/aQute.open/tree/master/aQute.open.store.mongo.provider) to build the example.
Chuck also delivered an [excellent video](http://erp-academy.chuckboecking.com/?page_id=3789) about the subject. Highly recommended.
