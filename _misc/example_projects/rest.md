#  REST Application Skeleton

## GitHub Repository

Go to [GitHub](https://github.com/osgi/osgi.enroute.examples/tree/master/osgi.enroute.examples.rest.application)

## Description
This project demonstrates the use of the [OSGi enRoute REST API][5]. This API allows you to write POJO code that is mapped to REST with JSON as payload. The project shows in the [RestApplication][6] class a number of examples that manipulate a history. All the examples are turned into a web page that allows you to execute them easily with a mouse click.

If you intend to use REST as the transport between your back-end and front-end then you might want to checkout JSON RPC.
