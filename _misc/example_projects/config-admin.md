## Description
The OSGi Configuration Admin is a a significant part of the reason why OSGi is so powerful. Its primary trick is to reverse the normal flow where an app looks for configuration to a model where the app is called with the configuration. (Another don’t call us, we’ll call you!) However, this novel approach is often not well understood. Add to that the subtle difference between factories and singletons and you’ve got a lot of confused people. This example shows lots of examples on an OSGi enRoute GUI.
