## Description
Sometimes one could wonder what the initial designers of OSGi were smoking when designing the core APIs. Though the APIs were top from a point of view of specification, consistency, clarity, and power, they sucked quite badly because they required lots of boiler plate. Fortunately, Declarative Services changed all that. DS combines the awesome power of OSGi and type safe Java with the friendliness of a script language.
This project shows lots of examples of what you can do with OSGi Declarative Services.
