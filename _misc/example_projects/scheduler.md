## Description

The [OSGi enRoute Scheduler API][7] is quite awe inspiring. It heavily uses the Promises and lambdas to make async programming simple in OSGi. It supports all the important features like deadlines, delays, and Cron like scheduling. This example is a GUI that calls lots of examples in the back end. It is a really nice way to explore the Scheduler API.
