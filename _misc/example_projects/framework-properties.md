#  Framework Properties

## GitHub Repository

Go to [GitHub](https://github.com/osgi/osgi.enroute.examples/tree/master/osgi.enroute.examples.properties.application)

## Description

A quite simplistic example GUI application that reads the properties from framework and shows them on the UI. The properties are accessed using a REST API. Small and maybe not that useful but it is a skeleton of a REST application so that might be interesting.
