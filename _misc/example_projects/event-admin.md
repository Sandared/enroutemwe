#  Event Admin & Javascript’s Server Sent Events

## GitHub Repository

Go to [GitHub](https://github.com/osgi/osgi.enroute.examples/blob/master/osgi.enroute.examples.easse.application)

## Description
How often did you write a browser application and wished you could easily get the events from the server? Your sorrows are over! OSGi enRoute contains a helper bundle (osgi.enroute.easse.simple.adapter) that makes it trivial to receive the events from Event Admin the browser as Server Sent Events. The OGSi enRoute perspective has an example project to demonstrate how awesome this support is.
